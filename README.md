# AI-Powered Image Captioning GUI with Tkinter and Hugging Face Transformers

This project is an AI-powered application that generates captions for images through a graphical interface (GUI) built with Python’s Tkinter. It leverages Hugging Face’s BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model to generate contextually relevant captions for selected images. The project demonstrates AI capabilities in an accessible and user-friendly format.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple GUI built with Tkinter, enabling easy image selection and caption viewing.
- **AI-Powered Image Captioning**: Uses the BLIP model from Hugging Face’s Transformers library to generate descriptive captions.
- **Batch Processing**: Allows users to select and caption multiple images at once.
- **Scrollable Image Display**: A scrollable canvas to navigate multiple images and captions within the same window.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the application.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image handling, resizing, and display compatibility with Tkinter.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Provides the BLIP model and processor for AI-powered image captioning.
- **PyTorch**: Powers the underlying model used in the Transformers library.

## Usage
1. **Select Images**: Click on the "Select Images" button to open a file dialog, where you can choose one or more images from your system.
2. **View Generated Captions**: Each selected image will appear in the GUI with an AI-generated caption below it.
3. **Scroll through Images**: If you select multiple images, use the scroll bar to view all images and captions within the application window.
